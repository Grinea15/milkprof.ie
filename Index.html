              <h2 class="py-2">Kefir Is a Fantastic Source of Many Nutrients</h2>
              <p>Kefir is a fermented drink, traditionally made using cow’s milk or goat’s milk.</p>
              <p>Over approximately 24 hours, the microorganisms in the kefir multiply and ferment the sugars in the milk, turning it into kefir.</p>
              <p>In other words, kefir is the drink, but kefir are the starter culture that you use to produce the beverage.</p>
              <p>Kefir originated from parts of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. The name is derived from the Turkish word <i>keyif</i>, which means “feeling good” after eating.</p>
              <p> lactic acid bacteria turn the milk’s lactose into lactic acid, so kefir tastes sour like yogurt — but has a thinner consistency.</p>
              <p>A 6-ounce (175-ml) serving of low-fat kefir contains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Protein</b>: 4 grams</li>
                <li><b>Calcium</b>: 10% of the RDI</li>
                <li><b>Phosphorus</b>: 15% of the RDI</li>
                <li><b>Vitamin B12</b>: 12% of the RDI</li>
                <li><b>Riboflavin (B2)</b>: 10% of the RDI</li>
                <li><b>Magnesium</b>: 3% of the RDI</li>
                <li>A decent amount of vitamin D</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, kefir has about 100 calories, 7–8 grams of carbs and 3–6 grams of fat, depending on the type of milk used.</p>
              <p>Kefir also contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, including organic acids and peptides that contribute to its health benefits.</p>

          <h2 class="py-2">Kefir Is a More Powerful Probiotic Than Yogurt</h2>
          <p>Some microorganisms can have beneficial effects on health when ingested</p>
          <p>Known as probiotics, these microorganisms may influence health in numerous ways, aiding digestion, weight management and mental health.</p>
          <p>Yogurt is the best known probiotic food in the Western diet, but kefir is actually a much more potent source.</p>
          <p>Kefir contain up to 61 strains of bacteria and yeasts, making them a very rich and diverse probiotic source, though diversity may vary</p>

            <h2 class="py-2">Kefir Has Potent Antibacterial Properties</h2>
            <p>Certain probiotics in kefir are believed to protect against infections.</p>
            <p>This includes the probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri, which is unique to kefir.</p>
            <p>Studies demonstrate that this probiotic can inhibit the growth of various harmful bacteria, including <i>Salmonella, Helicobacter pylori</i> and <i>E. coli</i>.</p>
            <p>Kefiran, a type of carbohydrate present in kefir, also has antibacterial properties.</p>

              <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

          <h2 class="py-2">Kefir Can Improve Bone Health and Lower the Risk of Osteoporosis</h2>
          <p>Osteoporosis is characterized by deterioration of bone tissue and is a major problem in Western countries.</p>
          <p>It is especially common among older women and dramatically raises your risk of fractures.</p>
          <p>Ensuring an adequate calcium intake is one of the most effective ways to improve bone health and slow the progression of osteoporosis.</p>
          <p>Recent animal studies link kefir to increased calcium absorption in bone cells. This leads to improved bone density, which should help prevent fractures</p>
          <div class="container p-5 border-start border-4 border-danger rounded fonce-1">
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Kefir made from dairy is an excellent source of calcium, and full-fat dairy kefir also contains vitamin K2. These nutrients have major benefits for bone health.</p>

          <h2 class="py-2">Kefir May Be Protective Against Cancer</h2>
          <p>Cancer is one of the world’s leading causes of death.</p>
          <p>It occurs when abnormal cells in your body grow uncontrollably, such as in a tumor.</p>
          <p>The probiotics in fermented dairy products are believed to reduce tumor growth by stimulating your immune system. Therefore, it is possible that kefir may fight cancer.</p>
          <p>This protective role has been demonstrated in several test-tube studies.</p>
          <p>One study found that kefir extract reduced the number of human breast cancer cells by 56%, compared to only 14% for yogurt extract.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that human studies are needed before firm conclusions can be made.</p>
          <div class="container p-5 border-start border-4 border-danger rounded fonce-1">
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Some test-tube and animal studies indicate that kefir can inhibit cancer cell growth. However, there are no current studies in people.</p>

          <h2 class="py-2">The Probiotics in It May Help With Various Digestive Problems</h2>
          <p>Probiotics such as kefir can help restore the balance of friendly bacteria in your gut.</p>
          <p>This is why they are highly effective at treating many forms of diarrhea.</p>
          <p>What’s more, ample evidence suggests that probiotics and probiotic foods can alleviate many digestive problems</p>
          <p>These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcers caused by H. pylori infection and many others.</p>
          <p>For this reason, kefir may be useful if you have problems with digestion.</p>
          <div class="container p-5 border-start border-4 border-danger rounded fonce-1">
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

          <h2 class="py-2">Kefir Is Low in Lactose</h2>
          <p>Regular dairy foods contain a natural sugar called lactose.</p>
          <p>Many people, especially adults, are unable to break down and digest lactose properly. This condition is called lactose intolerance.</p>
          <p>The lactic acid bacteria in fermented dairy foods — like kefir and yogurt — turn the lactose into lactic acid, so these foods are much lower in lactose than milk.</p>
          <p>They also contain enzymes that can help break down the lactose even further.</p>
          <p>Therefore, kefir is generally well tolerated by people with lactose intolerance, at least compared to regular milk.</p>
          <div class="container p-5 border-start border-4 border-danger rounded fonce-1">
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>Kefir is low in lactose because its lactic acid bacteria have already pre-digested the lactose. People who have lactose intolerance can often drink kefir without problems.</p>

          <h2 class="py-2">Kefir May Improve Allergy and Asthma Symptoms</h2>
          <p>Allergic reactions are caused by inflammatory responses against certain foods or substances.</p>
          <p>People with an over-sensitive immune system are more prone to allergies, which can provoke conditions like asthma.</p>
          <p>In animal studies, kefir has been shown to suppress inflammatory responses related to allergies and asthma.</p>
          <p>Human studies are needed to better explore these effects.</p>
          <div class="container p-5 border-start border-4 border-danger rounded fonce-1">
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
